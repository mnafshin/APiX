APiX — The API Extension & Debugging Toolkit

APiX is a developer-first API debugging and extension toolkit.
It combines features of a proxy, man-in-the-middle debugger, and a plugin runtime — giving developers full control over requests and responses.

Think of it as:
	•	proxychains + mitmproxy + plugin framework
	•	With CLI, UI, and CI/CD support.

✨ Features (MVP Roadmap)

	•	🔌 Core Proxy (HTTP/HTTPS)

Intercept and inspect traffic with built-in MITM support.

	•	🧩 Plugin Runtime

Extend APiX with request/response tampering, mocking, logging, etc.

	•	⚡ Tampering Rules

Modify headers, rewrite bodies, or inject responses.

	•	📦 Cross-Platform

Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

	•	🛠 Developer-Friendly CLI

Run any app through APiX:

apix run curl https://example.com


	•	🗂 Storage (MVP)

Capture requests in memory, with optional export to JSON.

🔧 Getting Started (MVP)

1. Build the Engine

cd cmd/apix-engine
go build -o apix-engine
./apix-engine

2. Run the CLI

cd cmd/apix-cli
go build -o apix
./apix run curl https://example.com

3. View Captured Traffic

./apix log

🧩 Plugins

Plugins can extend APiX by hooking into request/response flows.
Example built-in plugins:
	•	HeaderEditor → add/modify headers
	•	EnvSubst → replace ${VARS} with environment values
	•	MockResponse → fake API responses

Custom plugins can be developed using the APiX plugin SDK.
